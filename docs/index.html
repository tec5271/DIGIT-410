          <h2>Prize Pools</h2>
          
          
          <p>The prize pool for Esports tournaments is determined through a combination of factors, including sponsorship, ticket sales, and crowdfunding.

Sponsorship: Many Esports tournaments are sponsored by companies that want to promote their brand and reach the large and engaged Esports audience. These sponsors can contribute significant amounts of money to the tournament's prize pool.

Ticket sales: Some Esports tournaments sell tickets to fans who want to watch the event live. The revenue from ticket sales can go towards the prize pool, with a portion of each ticket sold being added to the overall prize pool.

Crowdfunding: Some Esports tournaments use crowdfunding to raise money for their prize pool. This involves setting a target prize pool amount and encouraging fans to contribute through platforms like Kickstarter or GoFundMe. Fans can donate money to the prize pool in exchange for rewards, such as exclusive merchandise or the opportunity to play with the pros.

In some cases, the prize pool for an Esports tournament can exceed expectations due to unexpected popularity or additional contributions from sponsors or fans. This was the case with The International, which started as a modest tournament in 2011 with a $1.6 million USD prize pool and has since grown into a massive event with a record-breaking $40 million USD prize pool in 2021.
My findings with the data on this chart were easy to undersatand due to my background in gaming and seeing just how large scale communities of these 10 games are. The two front runners that are outliers by a long shot 'Dota 2' and 'League of Legends' have some of the most passionate gamers backing their competetive scene. So their ability to crowdfund these events makes their large sums of money in the prize pool possible. If they were not able to rally the users of the game to support as much as they do then their funds would be much less significant. It also comes down to the developer company of the game to decide how much money they can give and still make profit off the event. Some companies in my opinion can be stingy with the allocating of prize funds. For example, 'Epic Games' the creators of Fortnite essentially grow money on trees due to their games success, but as the chart shows they much rather pocket most of that money.

<h2>Paid Players</h2>
         

<p>Esports players can be paid in several ways, including salaries, winnings, sponsorships, and streaming revenue.

Salaries: Many professional Esports teams pay their players a salary, which is often a fixed amount of money paid regularly, such as monthly or bi-weekly. Salaries can vary depending on the team, game, and region, but top players can earn salaries that rival those of traditional professional athletes.

Winnings: Esports players can earn significant amounts of money from tournament winnings. As we discussed earlier, some Esports tournaments offer massive prize pools, and the winning team or player can take home a substantial portion of that prize money. The amount of money an Esports player can earn from winnings depends on their skill level, the game they play, and the tournaments they participate in.

Sponsorships: Many Esports players earn money through sponsorships from companies looking to promote their products or services to the Esports audience. Sponsorship deals can include social media promotions, jersey branding, and event appearances, among other things. The amount of money an Esports player can earn from sponsorships depends on their popularity, reach, and the companies they partner with.

Streaming revenue: Esports players can also earn money from streaming their gameplay on platforms like Twitch or YouTube. Streamers can earn money through subscriptions, donations, and ad revenue. The amount of money an Esports player can earn from streaming depends on their popularity, consistency, and the size of their audience.

The pay of Esports players is determined by several factors, including their skill level, popularity, and the game they play. Top players in popular games like Dota 2, League of Legends, and Fortnite can earn salaries and winnings that rival those of traditional professional athletes. Additionally, the Esports industry continues to grow, and as it does, we may see even more opportunities for players to earn money in the future.</p>

<h2>Sponsors vs. Viewership</h2>
          

<p>Sponsors play a crucial role in esports, as they provide financial support for teams, events, and individual players, which in turn helps to promote the sport and increase its visibility. One way that sponsors can impact viewership in esports is by investing in marketing campaigns and promotional activities that help to increase awareness of the sport and its players.

Here are some ways that sponsors can change the number of viewership in esports:</p>

<p><b> Marketing and Promotion:</b> Sponsors can invest in marketing campaigns and promotions that help to raise awareness of esports and its players. For example, a sponsor might run an online advertising campaign, sponsor an esports tournament, or create social media content to help promote the sport.</p>

<p><b> Production Quality:</b> Sponsors can also invest in improving the quality of esports broadcasts and streams. This might include investing in better camera equipment, hiring more experienced production staff, or improving the overall presentation of the event. This can help to attract a larger audience, as viewers are more likely to watch events that are professionally produced and visually appealing.</p>

<p><b>Greater Prize Money:</b> Sponsors can also impact viewership by increasing the prize money available at esports tournaments. Higher prize money attracts more professional players and teams to participate, which in turn leads to higher quality matches and greater viewer interest.</p>

<p><b>Branding and Product Placement:</b> Sponsors can also use branding and product placement to reach esports viewers. This might involve sponsoring a particular team or player, or including branded products or advertising in esports broadcasts.</p>

<p><b>Cross-promotion:</b> Sponsors can also use cross-promotion to reach new audiences. For example, a sponsor might partner with a popular esports streamer or influencer to promote their products or services to their audience.</p>
