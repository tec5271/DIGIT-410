          <h2>Prize Pools</h2>
          <p>My findings with the data on this chart were easy to undersatand due to my background in gaming and seeing just how large scale communities of these 10 games are. The two front runners that are outliers by a long shot 'Dota 2' and 'League of Legends' have some of the most passionate gamers backing their competetive scene. So their ability to crowdfund these events makes their large sums of money in the prize pool possible. If they were not able to rally the users of the game to support as much as they do then their funds would be much less significant. It also comes down to the developer company of the game to decide how much money they can give and still make profit off the event. Some companies in my opinion can be stingy with the allocating of prize funds. For example, 'Epic Games' the creators of Fortnite essentially grow money on trees due to their games success, but as the chart shows they much rather pocket most of that money. </p>
